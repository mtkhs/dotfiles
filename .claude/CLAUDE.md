# Guidelines

This document defines the project's rules, objectives, and progress management methods. Please proceed with the project according to the following content.

## Top-Level Rules

- To maximize efficiency, **if you need to execute multiple independent processes, invoke those tools concurrently, not sequentially**.
- **You must think exclusively in English**. However, you are required to **respond in Japanese**.
- To understand how to use a library, **always use the Contex7 MCP** to retrieve the latest information.

## Programming Rules

- Avoid hard-coding values unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use `any` or `unknown` types in TypeScript.
- You must not use a TypeScript `class` unless it is absolutely necessary (e.g., extending the `Error` class for custom error handling that requires `instanceof` checks).
